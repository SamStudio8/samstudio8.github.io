title: "Playing Phylogenetic Hide and Seek with Protozoa [WIP]"
---

Amanda suggested that alongside archaeal, bacterial and fungal associated hydrolases,
we should also look at [**protozoans**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa). 
No problem, I'll just get the taxonomy ID for protozoa and extract another database
from UniProtKB [as before]({% post_url 2015-04-24-trembling %}). Simple! Or so I thought...

Classification of protozoa appears to be less clear than I had realised. UniProtKB
[lists three taxonomy entries](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/?query=protozoa&sort=score)
for the term:

* uncultured rumen protozoa
* uncultured Canadian Arcott wether rumen protozoa
* uncultured protist

But none of these are really what I'm looking for. So what am I looking for?
In an early introduction to my project, I described the protozoa as:

<blockquote>[...] single celled micro-organisms that feed from their direct surroundings
and have the capacity for controlled movement with a tendency to thrive in moist
environments [...]</blockquote>

But it seems the answer to "What are protozoa?" is quite complicated and boils down to
who you ask, or rather, whose interpretation of the taxonomic system you ask.
