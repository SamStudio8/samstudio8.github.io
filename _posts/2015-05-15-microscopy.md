The basement of the "old" biology building on campus is lined with beautiful microscopy images which
I'd always been curious about. I recently contacted the team who maintain the various machines who were
kind enough to offer some of their time to show their laboratory and demonstrate some of the processes
involved.

Today [Vic]() and I had the opportunity to try out taking some micrographs for ourselves.
As additional steps are necessary for pre-processing biological samples (primarily the time consuming
step of freezing), we decided to find something interesting but not alive that the lab might
not have had seen before. We settled on bring along a bag of various 3D-printing filaments that
each demonstrated some interesting property that we hoped would lead to interesting images too.

First up; Lulzbot [Laywoo-D3](https://www.lulzbot.com/products/laywoo-d3-cherry-laywood-3mm-250g-coil-cc-products),
designed to look like wood when printed and

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect but imagined obvious chunks of wood or brick like to feature...
...I guess these products 

[Laybrick](https://www.lulzbot.com/products/laybrick-filament-3mm),
[Ninja Flex](https://www.lulzbot.com/ninjaflex) and
[Glow in the Dark ABS](https://www.lulzbot.com/products/abs-3mm-filament-1kg-reel)

The imaging process was significantly more fiddly than I had anticipated, with each movement of the beam
to another part of the sample often requiring re-calibrating even to get a reasonable idea of whether you'd
like to make an image...
