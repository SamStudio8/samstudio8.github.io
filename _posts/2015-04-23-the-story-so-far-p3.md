At the end of my [previous post]({{ page.previous.url }}), I was left in a crumpled heap after learning the hard way that
not only is the `FASTQ` format specification somewhat non-existent but that I am also poor at reading reports I myself
generated; *wasting*[^1] time attempting to solve a problem that simply did not exist.

So, with our two large `FASTQ` files, now *stringently* confirmed to have the same number of sequences, I could begin to
look at the next station on my whistle-stop tour of your average metagenomics pipeline.

# Assembly
## velvet
### BIGASSEMBLY
### VBIGASSEMBLY

# tl;dr

[^1]: I use this word lightly as it was something to learn nonetheless.
