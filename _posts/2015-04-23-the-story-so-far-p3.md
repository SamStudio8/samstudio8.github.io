At the end of my [previous post]({{ page.previous.url }}), I was left in a crumpled heap after learning the hard way that
not only is the `FASTQ` format specification somewhat non-existent but that I am also poor at reading reports I myself
generated; *wasting*[^1] time attempting to solve a problem that simply did not exist.

So, with our two large FASTQ files containing ~195 million pairs of reads sequenced from the contents of ~60 extracted
limpet gastroinestinal tracts, now *stringently* confirmed to have the same number of sequences. I could finally begin to
look at the next station on my whistle-stop tour of the average metagenomics pipeline.
