title: "`memblame`"
---

As a curious and nosy individual who likes to know everything, I wrote a script dubbed `memblame`
which is responsible for naming and shaming authors of "inefficient"[^1] jobs at our cluster here in
[IBERS](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/).

It takes time, often days, sometimes longer, of patience to see large-input jobs executed on a node
on the compute cluster here. Typically this is down to the amount of RAM requested, only a handful
of nodes are actually capable of scheduling jobs that have a RAM quota of 250GB or larger. But
these nodes are [often busy](http://samstudio8.github.io/2015/02/13/ram/) with other tasks too.

One dreary afternoon [while waiting](https://xkcd.com/303/) a particularly long time for an
assembly to pop off the queue and begin, I started to wonder what the hold up was.

Our cluster is underpinned by Sun Grid Engine (SGE), a piece of software entrusted with scheduling
and management of submitted jobs that over the past few months I have formed a
[strong opinion](http://samstudio8.github.io/2015/02/17/sun-grid-engine/) on[^2].
When a job completes (regardless of exit status), SGE stores associated meta-data in plain-text in an "accounting" file on the cluster's root node.

# tl;dr
* I wrote a script to name and shame people who asked for more RAM than they needed.

[^1]: Although properly determining a metric to fairly represent efficiency is a task in itself.

[^2]: I'm also [writing software](https://github.com/samstudio8/sunblock) with the sole purpose of abstracting away having to deal with SGE entirely.
