excerpt: "I tried to extract a single integer from a core dump and instead fell in to an abyss and learned how to be a computer."

If you haven't already looked at what led me to this awful situation, check out what happened when
I [annihilated all my alignment]({% post_url 2015-05-01-aligned-annihilation %}) data.

I've managed to get `rapsearch` to generate two core dumps for inspection with `gdb` but I am struggling to
extract any useful information beyond what I already know. The `abort()` and `raise()` can clearly be
seen in the backtrace and prior to that, construction of a standard library exception. I presume `rapsearch`
was not compiled with debugging symbols, leaving us with those `??` frames.

{% gist 8c88fdd06cd250872d67 backtrace.gdb %}

Desperately attempting to avoid having to edit and recompile `rapsearch`, I began nosing around the core
in a similar fashion as one would poke a stick around in a dirty pond. At first I naively tried to explore
frame 3, treating `0x31926bcbd6` as "the exception" before realising the address was for a function responsible
for handling assignment of an exception[^7]. I'd have to try harder.

I started looking at the registers for the same frame, as the function accepts an exception pointer as a parameter
it should be stored in a register here. It was when I started reading about [x86 Calling Conventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI) that I realised I was
probably in over my head here. But I was victim to the sunken cost fallacy now, I had to continue.
I tried to disassemble the frame:

{% gist 8c88fdd06cd250872d67 disassemble_f3.gdb %}

It's [my understanding](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2535989/what-are-the-calling-conventions-for-unix-linux-system-calls-on-x86-64)
that the `%rdi` register contains the first parameter given to a function and so here I expect to see
some form of pointer to exception. I'll dump the values held in the registers at this frame too.

{% gist 8c88fdd06cd250872d67 registers_f3.gdb %}

Unfortunately `0xb96` doesn't appear to point to anything. I wondered whether it would be
worth trying to follow through the assembly instructions instead.
After determining [which way around](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/GAS_Syntax) to even read
the instructions[^9], I could become my own arch-nemesis, a computer:

```
[...]
sub    $0x28,%rsp   # Substract 28 from the stack pointer
                    # 0x7ffffffbb3e0 âˆ’ 0x28 = 0x7ffffffbb3b8
                    #
[...]
```

* * *

# tl;dr
* Life feels different now, I am on the other side. I have seen too much. I would very much like to never do this again.

    results containing questions pertaining to construction of flatpack furniture from a certain blue and yellow warehouse.
