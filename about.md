A twenty-four year old Computational Biology PhD student at Aberystwyth University. Previously a first class Computer Science and Statistics graduate, during the study for which I spent a year out with the Numerical Algorithms Group and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

I like telling computers to do things. I also like statistics.
